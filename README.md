# My Analysis of RawNet2 for Audio Spoofing Detection

I chose RawNet2 for its straightforward approach - it works directly with raw audio waveforms instead of requiring complex feature engineering, which is both elegant and practical. This is especially effective for real-time Logical Access scenarios.
What grabbed my attention is how it learns important patterns directly from raw audio, finding subtle characteristics without explicit programming. It feels like a breakthrough - letting the architecture discover discriminative features naturally rather than imposing human assumptions.
The performance numbers are convincing: EER of 1.12% and t-DCF of 0.033 for Logical Access scenarios, though it might struggle with background noise.
I was impressed by its clever attention mechanisms and efficient network design. It excels at finding tiny giveaways in fake speech - crucial for distinguishing real voices from AI during actual conversations. It's both accurate and fast enough for real-time use.
Technically, it combines EfficientNet-A0 with SE-Res2Net50 and adds an attention branch, using a mixed loss function (with triplet loss) to spot subtle deepfake artifacts.

Results:
- Logical access: 1.89% EER, 0.507 t-DCF
- Physical access: 0.86% EER, 0.024 t-DCF

My concern is its complexity might require significant adaptation for different languages or noisy environments, and could be challenging to run on smaller devices.
What really clicked was its inverted approach - instead of chasing every fake speech pattern (impossible with new AI emerging weekly), it focuses on understanding normal human speech. It creates a boundary of what "normal" is by learning from real speech samples, flagging outliers as suspicious.
It uses LFCC features with a ResNet18 backbone. The OC-Softmax loss function creates tighter decision boundaries around genuine speech patterns. Results were decent: 2.19% EER and 0.059 t-DCF for Logical Access.
A persistent issue was my roommate's accent sometimes being flagged as suspicious because his speech patterns weren't well-represented in the training data. This raises questions about handling real-world diversity in speaking styles, emotional states, and background conditions. Finding the optimal anomaly threshold proved trickier than expected.


1. Dataset and Preprocessing
The project uses the ASVspoof2017_V2_train dataset, which contains .wav audio files and a protocol file that provides labels for each file. The labels are either "genuine" (real human speech) or "spoof" (replayed or synthetic speech). The goal was to train a binary classifier to detect spoofed audio.

Preprocessing Steps
Audio loading: Used Librosa to load waveforms directly from the .wav files.

Standardizing length: Trimmed or zero-padded all audio to exactly 1 second (16,000 samples) for uniform input size.

Label parsing: Read the protocol file using Pandas and built a mapping from filenames to binary labels (genuine = 0, spoof = 1).

Dataset preparation: Created TensorFlow datasets using from_tensor_slices(), added shuffling, batching, and prefetching for efficient training.

Challenges Faced
File path mismatches and incorrect assumptions about directory structure caused initial loading issues, which were resolved through debugging and using os.path.join for proper path handling.

The protocol file required careful parsing because it was whitespace-delimited rather than comma-separated.

Ensuring alignment between the audio files and their corresponding labels took additional verification.

Assumptions
All audio files in the dataset were assumed to have a corresponding label in the protocol file.

Each audio sample was assumed to be informative enough within 1 second for spoofing detection.

The task was treated as binary classification.

2. Model Architecture and Implementation
The model architecture is inspired by RawNet2, designed for learning directly from raw waveforms without requiring precomputed features like spectrograms or MFCCs. This simplifies preprocessing and enables end-to-end training.

Model Layers (Explained)
First Conv1D Layer (32 filters): Captures basic temporal patterns in the waveform using a relatively wide kernel to identify coarse features.

Second Conv1D Layer (64 filters): With a smaller kernel, this layer focuses on more fine-grained details in the signal.

Batch Normalization: Normalizes activations during training to speed up convergence and stabilize learning.

Dropout (0.3 and 0.5): Reduces overfitting by randomly disabling a fraction of neurons during training.

MaxPooling1D: Downsamples the feature maps by keeping only the most prominent features in a sliding window. It helps reduce dimensionality and makes the model more robust to small shifts in the input.

GlobalAveragePooling1D: Aggregates the entire temporal dimension into a single feature vector, making it suitable for feeding into dense layers regardless of the input length.

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that finalize the learned features into a binary decision using a sigmoid activation function.
Training Setup
Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy, suitable for two-class problems.

Optimizer: Adam, for efficient and adaptive learning.

Metrics Monitored: Accuracy, AUC, precision, and recall.

3. Performance and Evaluation
Results on Validation Data:
Precision: 0.9761
Recall: 0.9795
F1-Score: 0.9778
ROC-AUC: 0.9961
Confusion Matrix:
[[304   7]
 [  6 286]]
This shows excellent overall performance with minimal false positives and false negatives.

Strengths
The model learns directly from raw audio, eliminating the need for handcrafted features.
It generalizes well on validation data, suggesting robustness.
The architecture is relatively lightweight, making it feasible for real-time or embedded use.

Limitations
The model requires all inputs to be exactly 1 second long. It may not generalize to variable-length or longer clips without modification.
It was tested on a controlled dataset; real-world audio might have more noise and variation.

Future Work
Introduce data augmentation (e.g., background noise, pitch shifting) to improve generalization.
Allow variable-length input handling through masking or attention mechanisms.
Fine-tune hyperparameters like the number of filters, dropout rates, and kernel sizes.
Evaluate on additional datasets to validate performance in more realistic conditions.

4. Reflection and Discussion
What were the most significant challenges?
Handling raw audio efficiently was initially tricky due to inconsistencies in file structure and length.

Preprocessing audio without explicit features like spectrograms required careful model tuning.

How might this model perform in real-world conditions?
In controlled environments, the model performs well. However, in real-world scenarios with background noise, overlapping speech, and varying microphone quality, performance could drop unless retrained with more diverse data.

What additional data or resources would help?
More diverse datasets with different spoofing techniques.

Noisy, multilingual, or far-field recordings.

Metadata like device type or speaker ID could offer additional context for better detection.

How would this be deployed in production?
Export the model using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for use on edge devices.

Preprocess audio input in real-time to standardize length before inference.

Integrate into voice authentication systems as a security filter.
